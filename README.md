<h1>MatoTask 🍅</h1>

<p><b><i>"Ketch-up in your goals." </i></b>✨</p>

<p><b>MatoTask</b> is a simple yet effective task manager. Built with a focus on user experience, it helps users declutter their minds by organizing daily goals into an intuitive interface.</p>

<p><b>Why I built this:</b> I wanted to apply everything I learned during the <a href="https://www.codedex.io/home" target="_blank">Codédex</a> JavaScript course. This project challenged me to handle DOM manipulation, state management, and persistent storage making it my proudest achievement as a web developer so far! 🌟٩(^ᗜ^ )و ´-</p>
